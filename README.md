# Overview of the A8 Sprite Editor functionality
This sprite editor features a simple user interface where sprite frames can be added, removed, and the pixels edited. There is a brush tool, flood fill tool, eraser, move tool, and undo button. Blank animation frames may be added or a frame may be duplicated. Additionally, frames may be removed.
